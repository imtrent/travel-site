# Travel Site

This site was built throughout a course on Udemy called "Git a Web Developer Job: Mastering the Modern Workflow" by Brad Schiff. Throughtout the course, I learned Git, Github, Node.js, NPM, Object-oriented JavaScript, ES6, webpack, Gulp, and BEM Methodology.
 
Here is a link to the final project! https://imtrent.github.io/travel-site/
